\textbf{Abstract:}

Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)—the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains—remains lacking. 
We present a principled SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) and operationalize it via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, AI-assisted experiments (dry/wet), and experimental reasoning. 
SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science’s 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20\%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. 
We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. 
Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.
